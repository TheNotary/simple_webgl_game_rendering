## Simple WebGl Game Rendering

These are just some simple html starting points for rendering graphical information using WebGL.  

It's to lead into 3D stuff, but I already have an unfinished 2D engine based on the canvas... I should finish that...

I'd like to do webGL Staf Fox (snes) so that's the context I'm writing this README in.  

## Notes

Framework of choice is THREE.js, they have good tuts.  

I should implement starfox based on this code:

http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_camera

And also consider looking into how texturing can be done and if AWD is good for importing models, and the animations... need to research collada.  It's all on that examples page.  Maybe blender is popular...

Will need a bare bones level editor, that's this tut http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/09/14/lets-make-a-3D-game-map-editor/

Will need to script flight plans, of not only the camera rail, but also the enemy mobs.
